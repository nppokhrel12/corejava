abstraction
process of hiding implementation details in the program is abstraction 
to achieve abstraction we have to use 

abstract class and  -> class which contain abstract and non abstract methods abs method -> mehtod which dont have body or implementation details 
eg. abstract void add();
we cannot create object of abstract class 
also know as level of abstraction (0-100)
variable allowed 

abstract class class_name{
//abstract methods and non abstract method
//non abstract methods
}  

interface -> same as class which contains public abstract methods and public statinc final varibales .
we cant create objects of interface 
also known ads 100 % abstraction 
syntax 
interface interface-name {
    //no need to write abstract
     //public abstract methods 
}
